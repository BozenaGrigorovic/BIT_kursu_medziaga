        <p>According to The Intelligence of Dogs, which ranks 131 dog breeds in terms of their relative intelligence, the border collie is the smartest dog breed known to man. Need proof? Chaser, a linguistically gifted border collie from South Carolina, could recognize over 1,000 words. But it’s not just a matter of being “book smart.” A descendant of European herding dogs that lived along the rocky borders of England, Scotland, and Wales, the border collie was bred to be crafty enough and athletic enough to survive the treacherous landscape. It’s also blessed with a strong work ethic. The AKC, which recognized the breed in 1995, describes the border collie not only as “smart, affectionate, and energetic,” but also as a “remarkably bright workaholic.”

            Border collie owners should be prepared to provide their doggo with lots of mental and physical stimulation, according to the AKC. The breed is so intelligent and good at communicating with humans that it’s not unreasonable to imagine that many are quite adept at getting what they want from their owners. That’s why we’re proclaiming the border collie the smartest dog in the world.

        <p>The poodle, one of a number of elegant French dog breeds, is often seen as high maintenance. (That curly hair isn’t going to style itself, after all.) But don’t be fooled into thinking that makes them any less clever. The breed gets high marks for its emotional and cognitive intelligence. In fact, Coren ranks the poodle second among the smartest dog breeds, right after the border collie.

            And yes, sure, the dogs can look a bit posh, but they’ve also been employed during wartime to deliver supplies to soldiers on the battlefield. The job required obedience, steadfast focus, and clear-headed decision-making, and quick-learning poodles became the obvious choice. Veterinarian Wendy Hauser, DVM, says poodles are readily trainable and enjoy activities that allow them to be challenged, such as hunting, tracking, agility sports, and obedience work. On top of all that, the breed has a jovial sense of humor and a tendency to perform tricks and deliberately act cute. Not that humans need more reasons to love ’em. No matter the size—from teacup to standard—poodles are oodles of fun and majorly cute.

        <p>
            The German shepherd is the second most intelligent herding dog and the third most intelligent dog overall, according to Coren’s ranking. The breed was bred for its high intelligence (they can learn a new command on the first go, according to the AKC), high level of focus, desire and ability to be obedient (which makes training easy), and protective instinct with regard to its fellow “pack” members.

One of this breed’s strengths is its ability to evaluate tricky situations and decide on the best course of action, according to Jill Cline, PhD, site director of the Royal Canin Pet Health and Nutrition Center in Lewisburg, Ohio. That’s one reason you’ll so often see German shepherds working in law enforcement, with search-and-rescue teams, and as service dogs for people with disabilities. In fact, it was the first dog breed taught to fulfill the role of Seeing Eye dog.

        <p>
            Canine intelligence isn’t just about brainpower. When it comes to golden retrievers, their willingness to “comply with commands or tasks asked of them by their owners,” as Cline put it, is what pushes them into the number four slot. Because of their impulse to please their humans, these pooches can be relied upon to act consistently in a variety of situations. Bred in Scotland to be hunting companions and game retrievers, they’re often employed in search-and-rescue operations, assisted by their relative agility and powerful gait.

As diligent of a worker as the golden retriever is, it’s also beloved around the world as a dependable, obedient companion. A sunny disposition and aptitude for learning commands (as many as 200 of them, most learned on the first try) make the golden retriever the preferred pet for people with disabilities. Fun fact: These pups are also some of the best dogs for seniors to own.

        <p>
            Described by the AKC as fearless, loyal, and alert, the highly intelligent and readily trainable Doberman pinscher was bred by a German tax collector who had a bit of extra time on his hands during the off-season, as well as an abundance of motivation to breed the perfect canine bodyguard. (Because let’s face it: People can get awfully cranky when the tax collector comes to call.)

“Known for their fearless nature, speed, and deep stamina,” these tough but elegant-looking, robustly athletic creatures make ideal guard dogs, according to Coren. But as intimidating as this fierce-looking dog breed may appear, the breed is actually known for being quite gentle. That, and they’re among the dogs that take amazingly well to training.

        <p>
            The compact Shetland sheepdog does everything a larger herding dog can do but on considerably less food. That’s precisely why they were bred as the “collie’s little cousin.” Farmers on the UK’s Shetland Islands used them to perform herding duties, and not just for sheep. The sheltie, as it is known by some, found work herding ponies and poultry as well.

Eager to please and motivated to keep trying until they get it right, shelties are great at learning new commands in just a few repetitions. Because of their relative intelligence, obedience, and quickness on their feet, they’re ranked sixth on Coren’s list of the smartest dog breeds. Like golden retrievers, Shetland sheepdogs are loved as much for their canine intelligence as for their personalities, and they’re also one of the best dog breeds for families with children. And yet as tiny as these fluffballs are, they also make excellent guard dogs, thanks to their ability to sense danger. That’s instinctive intelligence right there.

        <h2>Labrador retriever</h2>

        <p>
            Developed by 16th-century settlers of the Canadian island of Newfoundland, the Labrador retriever is a descendant of the St. John Dog (which is no longer around) and a relative of the Newfoundland. The breed got its name in the 19th century, after English nobles returned from a Canadian visit with what they called the “Labrador dog.”

Once on English soil, the Labrador retriever’s breed characteristics (like its water-repellant coat) were honed even further so it would be adept at retrieving ducks on hunts. Coren ranks it the seventh most intelligent dog breed, highlighting its stunning sense of smell and ability to make good judgments based thereon. The Labrador retriever is known for self-training—it can and wants to learn from humans, not by being taught but by watching and imitating. For all these reasons, this lovable autodidact is the number one most popular dog breed in the United States, a favorite among people with disabilities, and one of the best emotional support dogs.

            In Coren’s ranking, the smallest of the smartest dog breeds is the papillon. One of a number of adorably big-eared pups, the breed can trace its roots back almost 700 years—and that plays a significant role in its intelligence, according to Caitie Steffen, a pet expert with animal activity tracker company Whistle, and Angela Hughes, DVM, PhD, a veterinarian geneticist with dog DNA test kit Wisdom Panel. As one of the oldest dog breeds, the papillon has had more time than many to evolve into one of the world’s smartest dogs, and its breeders have used that time wisely.

The papillon, whose name is the French word for “butterfly” and a nod to its winglike ears, originated as a companion for members of the nobility. According to the AKC, they come from European spaniel lineage but were bred with toy dogs to become miniaturized. Their happy, outgoing demeanor is coupled with an eagerness to please and a high aptitude for learning and obeying commands, making these little guys natural companions.
